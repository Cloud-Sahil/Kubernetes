# Kubernetes Deamonset
---
- A Kubernetes DaemonSet ensures a specific pod runs on all (or a subset of) nodes in a cluster. As nodes are added or removed, the DaemonSet automatically adds or removes the required pods, making it ideal for background tasks like logging agents, monitoring, and network plugins.
### Features of DaemonSets

 - Runs one pod per node.
 - Automatically schedules pods on newly added nodes.
 - Ensures uninterrupted system monitoring and logging.
